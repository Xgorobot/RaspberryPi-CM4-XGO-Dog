## Project Introduction

XGO-DOG is a desktop-level AI robot dog with twelve degrees of freedom. It features a robotic arm and an end-effector claw mounted on its back. The robot integrates a Raspberry Pi CM4 module for AI edge computing. It uses 4.5KG.CM all-metal magnetic encoding bus serial servos for the joints, enabling omnidirectional movement, six-dimensional posture control, stability, various gaits, and gripping tasks. The robot is equipped with IMU, joint position sensors, and current sensors, which provide feedback on posture, joint angles, and torque for internal algorithms and secondary development. The system supports cross-Python programming and ROS programming.

    ```

3. Run the main program:
    ```bash
    sudo python3 main.py
    ```

## Features

1. Web remote control: Visual remote control based on flacksocket.

3. Xiaozhi interaction: Fun interactions with Xiaozhi.

## ðŸ“œ Changelog
### 2025-04-14
- **Code Improvement**: Optimized language switching in `/RaspberryPi-CM4-main/demos/language.py` so that the system no longer requires a restart to change languages.
- **New Feature**: Added the `update.sh` script. Running this script will optimize system boot time.
